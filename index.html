        <p>Hello, my name is Jordann Santos and I'm from Curitiba, Brazil.
            As a Graphic Designer, I decided to study Web Development and Web and Computer Programming at BYU Idaho to
            increase my skills and get new opportunities. I love soccer, Counter Strike and creating brands (visual
            identities) through Graphic Design.
            I'm excited and motivated to learn with all of you every day.
