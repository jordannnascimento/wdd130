        <p>Hello, my name is Jordann Santos and I'm from Curitiba, Brazil.
            As a Graphic Designer, I decided to study Web Development and Web and Computer Programming at BYU Idaho to
            increase my skills and get new opportunities. I love soccer, Counter Strike and creating brands (visual
            identities) through Graphic Design.
            I'm excited and motivated to learn with all of you every day. Throughout my career, I have successfully led
            design projects that increased brand visibility and sales performance
            across various industries. I work well in dynamic environments and use tools like Adobe Creative Suite and
            Figma to
            create high-quality designs that connect with target audiences.

            My experience includes managing design teams and collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders to develop
            branding
            strategies. I have implemented efficient workflows using project management methodologies like Agile and
            Scrum, helping
            the team communicate better and boosting overall productivity by 20%.
